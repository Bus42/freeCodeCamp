## Survey Form
The version used to pass the automated tests is on [Codepen]('https://codepen.io/Bus42/pen/QZYoVE').

So, I had a little fun writing this one. It's obviousy a joke form and you won't win anything, though I've no idea why anyone would intentionally visit The Gardens. Although, if you can answer any of the evaluation questions then you've done the impossible.

Also, just to be a little extra annoying, I hid a couple of surprises in the form - which I'll probably come back and do every once in a while.
